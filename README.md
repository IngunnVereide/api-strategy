# Equinor API Strategy

Application programming interfaces (APIs) are a core element of any digital business platform. APIs provide the interfaces between apps, data and services. These interfaces enables the connection between people, businesses and things. With proper management, APIs can be an enabler for innovation, faster development of digital products and new business models. This can positively affect the profitability of the company, a concept referred to in the industry as _the API Economy_. 

With the latest version of TR1621 (v7), Equinor is heading in an "API first" direction; software components should offer APIs to communicate with other components, share data and functionality. To further capitalize on the potentials of the API Economy, CIT via Chief Engineer IT is establishing an API Strategy. The API strategy outlines the direction for management, design and development of APIs in Equinor.
