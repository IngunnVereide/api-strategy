# API Management tool decision

**Azure API Management** has been selected as the API management tool.

Azure API Management (Azure APIM) provides an adequate feature set to support what Equinor wants to achieve
with an API management tool, ref https://github.com/Statoil/api-strategy/blob/master/docs/api_management.md
Azure APIM provides security mechanisms, such as throttling, token validation and logging/monitoring 
functionality. It provides an API that will enable the OMNIA teams to build a portal for API publishers.
It also provides an API portal for consumers that can be customized to provide a good developer experience
for API consumers.

Equinor have established an API team within OMNIA that will have operational responsibility for Azure API 
Management. This team has already gained experience in this tool. Choosing another tool than APIM would come 
with a cost, and even though other API management tools might provide a richer feature set, there would have
to be a considerable difference in capability to justify choosing another tool. Such a difference has not
been identified.
